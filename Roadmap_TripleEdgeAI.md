# Triple Edge AI Roadmap

## GOAL

To develop and launch the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the Triple Edge AI application by July 31, 2023. This application will offer AI-powered task breakdown, dynamic visualization, intuitive progress tracking, scalable directory folder hierarchy, and efficient goal management.

### TOOLS

The MERN technology stack, which includes MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js.

### DEADLINE

July 31, 2023

## ROADMAP

### PHASE I: Frontend Development with React.js (July 9 - July 18)

#### OBJECTIVE I: Set up the Frontend Environment

**TASK I:** Confirm Installation of Necessary Tools

**SUB-TASK:** Check in Visual Studio Code terminal if Node.js and npm (node package manager) are installed.

**STEPS:**

1. Open the terminal in Visual Studio Code.
2. Run `node -v`. If Node.js is installed, this will print the version number in the terminal.
3. Run `npm -v`. If npm is installed, this will print the version number in the terminal.
4. If either is not installed, download and install [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

**TASK II:** Create a new React Application

**SUB-TASK:** Use create-react-app to start a new project.

**STEPS:**

1. Open the terminal in Visual Studio Code.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want your project to be.
3. Run `npx create-react-app triple-edge-ai`.
4. Once the process is completed, navigate into your new project folder with `cd triple-edge-ai`.

#### OBJECTIVE II: Develop Basic Frontend Components

This objective, its tasks, sub-tasks, and steps will be more specific to your application needs and might involve creating the layout, designing and implementing individual components, setting up routing, etc.

### PHASE II: Backend Development with Express.js and MongoDB (July 19 - July 27)

#### OBJECTIVE I: Set up the Backend Environment

**TASK I:** Confirm Installation of MongoDB

**SUB-TASK:** Check if MongoDB is installed.

**STEPS:**

1. Open the terminal in Visual Studio Code.
2. Run `mongo --version`. If MongoDB is installed, this will print the version number in the terminal.
3. If MongoDB is not installed, download and install [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).

#### OBJECTIVE II: Develop Backend API

This objective involves creating the backend API with Express.js and connecting it to your MongoDB database.

### PHASE III: Integration and Testing (July 28 - July 30)

#### OBJECTIVE: Connect Frontend and Backend

This phase involves making sure that the frontend and backend communicate correctly, debugging, and setting up error handling.

### PHASE IV: Launch (July 31)

#### OBJECTIVE: Deploy the MVP

This phase involves deploying your application, monitoring its performance, and gathering user feedback.

Please note that each of these tasks can be further broken down into sub-tasks and steps using the Triple Edge AI system.
